						<!-- <p>Welcome to the Korean Dietetic Association (KDA).</p><br />
						<p>I wish your health and good luck for this year.<br />
						I would like to express my gratitude to you for reelecting me as the 24th chairman of KDA.<br />
						It is an honor to serve KDA, and at the same time I feel very responsible considering that the role of dietitians to improve people's health is increasingly becoming important these days.</p><br />
						<p>With the trust and confidence in members who elected me, I will put my whole passion in improving public health in close cooperation with the 24th executive members of KDA for the next two years.<br />
						I will also do my best to improve the rights and interests of 150,000 dietitians in Korea.<br /> KDA has consistently carried out the activities for dietitians and people, and it will continue to 
						exert an effort to develop the public health and medical system in Korea.<br /><br /></p>
						<p>For the past 50 years, Korea has experienced drastic change and economic growth.<br />
						However, the western-style eating habits have spread along with the splendid economic achievement, thus increasing chronic degenerative diseases. <br />
						Such problems even affect young children. From a long-term perspective, it can be great loss to the national economy. <br />The change in people's eating habits demands more roles to dietitians. <br />
						Therefore, we, dietetics professionals, should do continuous research and self-development to keep pace with the rapid changes in people's diet.<br /><br /></p>
						<p>I hope this homepage will serve as a useful venue where dietetics professionals can share different experiences and the vivid knowledge and information gained through the practice.<br />
						In addition, I hope this site will play a role to make the people aware of the importance of eating habits, and to publicize the role of dietitians. <br />
						KDA promises that this homepage will be updated as quickly possible, and will address questions and problems you raise.<br /><br /></p>
						<p>You are always wecome to make comments and suggestions on how this site can be improved.<br /><br /></p>
						<p>Thank you for visiting the KDA homepage once again. <br /> Good luck and happiness to all of you!</p> -->
